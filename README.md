# Customer-Behavior-Data-Analysis-Project.
Data analysis project showcasing customer behavior analysis using Python, SQL and Power BI.

🧠 Data Analytics Project — From Data to Insights

📋 Overview
This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end data analytics workflow — from data collection and cleaning to visualization and presentation.
The goal is to extract valuable business insights from a dataset using Python, SQL, and Power BI, and present the findings through a professional report and presentation.


📂 Dataset

Source: (https://github.com/keshav-hl/Customer-Behavior-Data-Analysis-Project./blob/main/customer_shopping_behavior.csv)

Format: CSV / Excel / SQL table

Description: Contains information about customer behavior, sales, transactions, or similar business metrics.

Size: ~ (mention number of rows & columns, e.g., 10,000 rows × 12 columns)


🛠️ Tools & Technologies
Category	Tools Used
Programming	Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Database	PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server
Visualization	Power BI
Reporting	Microsoft PowerPoint / Gamma App
Environment	Jupyter Notebook / VS Code


🚀 Project Steps

1. Data Loading

Imported dataset using Pandas in Python.

Connected to PostgreSQL/MySQL/SQL Server using SQLAlchemy and loaded data into SQL tables.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Checked dataset shape, null values, duplicates, and data types.

Performed descriptive statistics and correlation analysis.

Created visualizations (histograms, box plots, heatmaps) to identify trends and outliers.

3. Data Cleaning

Handled missing values using imputation or removal.

Standardized categorical data and converted data types.

Removed duplicates and irrelevant features.

Ensured consistency before exporting to the database.

4. SQL Analysis

Wrote and executed SQL queries to:

Aggregate data (SUM, AVG, COUNT)

Filter records using WHERE and GROUP BY

Join multiple tables

Identify top-performing categories, customers, or regions

5. Power BI Dashboard

Imported cleaned dataset or SQL output into Power BI.

Created interactive visuals:

KPIs (Total Sales, Average Order Value)

Regional performance map

Trend over time line chart

Customer segmentation by category

Designed an intuitive layout for business users.

6. Reporting

Summarized key insights, trends, and recommendations.

Created a professional presentation using Gamma App / PowerPoint highlighting:

Business questions

Analytical approach

Key findings

Visual snapshots of the Power BI dashboard



📊 Results & Insights

Discovered actionable patterns in customer behavior.

Identified top-performing products and underperforming regions.

Provided data-driven recommendations for business improvement.

Built a real-time interactive dashboard to monitor KPIs.
